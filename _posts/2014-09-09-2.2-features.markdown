Thanks to everyone who joined us for the 
[2.2 buy a feature](/blog/2014/08/2.2-buy-a-feature.html). Learning 
what our community values will help us make a better 
product. 

## Features

Here's the list of features purchased for 2.2:

## On Deck

The following two features were popular, but couldn't get enough points to 
be fully purchased.  Look for these as nice-to-haves:

 - Assorted Binding Improvements:
   - can-checked replaces can-value where appropriate. [issue](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/issues/1205)
   - can-href link helper. [issue](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/issues/1103), [upvote](http://bithub.com/event/40391)
   - can-EVENT arguments. [issue](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/issues/1219), [upvote](http://bithub.com/event/44023)

 - In page templates. [issue](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/issues/1215), [upvote](http://bithub.com/event/43978)

## Timeline

It's possible that these features are not released together.  For example,
if dirty checking lands, we might immediately release 2.2 and other features
in a later release.  

We are going to have someone working full-time on these features at the end of 
this month.  I'd expect them all to be done by year end.
