We have a blog! We plan on using it for several types of posts.

### Announcements

We'll write about new CanJS initiatives, like our [weekly community meetings](https://plus.google.com/108820831381167297339/posts) and changes to the website.

### Release articles

We'll be much better about releasing timely articles summarizing the new features, changes, and fixes in each release.

We'll also provide periodic updates about when releases are happening and previews of what they'll contain.

### Community meetings

We'll write up summaries of relevant details of our weekly community meetings, especially relating to any decisions that were made.

### User discussions

We'll often use this space to ask what our users want and hope to create a place to give feedback in the disqus comments below. We're interested especially in what new users are feeling. 

* What has been the hardest part of picking up CanJS? 
* What has prevented you from learning faster? 
* What do you think we should change to make your jobs easier, both in the code and the documentation?
* Which features on the roadmap are you most interested in?

### Short Examples

We'll post quick JSBin examples with short explanations that we think users would find as useful patterns.

### Architecture Discussions

We'll also be writing up discussions on JavaScript concepts we have strong opinions about that don't specifically belong in the tutorials or API docs. Things like: 

* hash based routing vs state based routing
* dirty checking vs observer API patterns
* web components

### External Content

Eventually, we'll include useful CanJS blog posts written in other places on the web, discovered and fed into this blog by Bithub.

### Whatever you want

Let us know in the comments below what type of content you want to see in the blog.
