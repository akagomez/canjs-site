Join CanJS’s core team of developers every Friday at 3pm CST as they present new features, discuss JavaScript application best practices and answer your questions.  Hangout with us this and every following Friday on Google Hangouts for 30-minute live CanJS Community Hangouts.
  
**What to expect**
  
- Short 7 minute presentations on CanJS features, best practices and interesting solutions (using can.route.map, wrapping existing widgets, etc).
- Guest presentations from companies that are using CanJS daily on internal and client projects.
- Debating best practices in JavaScript application and answering viewers questions.
