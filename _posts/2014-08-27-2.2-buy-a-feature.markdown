There's much to accomplish for CanJS 2.2 ... too much! We want to build what's 
most important to you, our community.  So on `Sept 9th at 6 PM CST` over 
[join.me](https://join.me/279-673-700) or 
at [CanJS Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/CanJS-Chicago/events/169891572/),
we will collectively "buy" (with [Bithub](http://bithub.com) points) 
some of the features listed in github.

Each feature has a price in Bithub points. 

Everyone attending the sale in person or online will get 5 points plus 
their [Bithub points](http://bithub.com/leaderboard) towards purchasing features.  Bithub
tracks our community's activity across github, twitter, and other sites. People
earn points by submitting and closing issues, creating content and getting upvoted for it.

There's only enough points to buy about half the features, 
so you will have to pool your money to get what you want.

You can lower the price by upvoting the issue on [Bithub](http://bithub.com/canjs/feature?state=open).

If you'd like to participate, please [email me](mailto:justin@bitovi.com) prior to the event, so
I can prepare 
your [points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174wFz-tLBzSL77Z0pUlCXxvL2g9uRwvaLJXGqCbZFYg/edit?usp=sharing).
_Everyone_ is welcome to participate.

## Event Agenda

Our hope is githat this will create a lot of discussion around what 
features are important to which people.  

The following is the event plan:

 - `6:00 PM CST` - I will go over each feature and what it means.  Questions can be asked over IRC.
 - `7:00 PM CST` - Floor will be open for 20 minutes for people to try to convince 
   people to purchase their favorite features.  
 - `7:20 PM CST` - Once all features have been explained, we 
   will cycle through each feature. 
   - Everyone will have the opportunity to put some of their points behind a feature. 
   - Each person will have 60 seconds to explain their decision.
   - Features have to be fully funded to be on our roadmap for 2.2.
   - Once all features have been discussed, people will be able to remove their points from a feature.
   - We will repeat this process until everyone's points are used up or we reach a stalemate.
