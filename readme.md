# CanJS.com - The CanJS website

## Setup

Clone this repository and install all submodules:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Next, install the required NPM modules:

	npm install

To generate the site, run:

    ./js scripts/doc.js

To adjust __styles__:

* Change what you find in `scripts/static/styles`.
* Don't change documentjs unless you want those changes to be applied to everything.
* What you find in `scripts/static` overwrites what's in `documentjs/site/default/static`.

To adjust __JS__:

* Copy `documentjs/site/default/static/static.js` to `scripts/static/static.js`.
* Add other scripts to `scripts/static/`. Steal those scripts within `static.js`.
* Make sure you use relative paths (`"./path/to.js"`).

To adjust __HTML__:

* change `scripts/templates/` or `_pages`.

After updating static content or templates, delete `documentjs/site/static/dist/production.css` and `docs/static/production.css` and run:

    ./js scripts/doc.js

Add __-f__ to force a new production.js and production.css like:

    ./js scripts/doc.js -f
    
Add __-c__ or __-concatonly__ to leave production unminified.

If you are having trouble building, open `/documentjs/site/static/build/build.html` in your 
browser. This page attempts to load all the static content of the site with steal.

## Folder structure

__NOTE:__ Folders starting with `_` won't show up on the Homepage ([More info about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)).

- `_guides` - Submodule for the [CanJS Wiki](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/wiki) GIT repository
- `_pages` - Mustache templates which will be rendered as their HTML equivalents in the root folder
- `can` - The [CanJS repository](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs) submodule
- `docs` - The generated documentation (from the `can` folder) - *Do not modify files in this folder*
- `guides` - The generated guides (from the `_guides` markdown files) - *Do not modify files in this folder*
- `img` - Image resources. This should be moved to `scripts/static/img`
- `resources` - Other resources like generated CSS and additional JavaScript. This should also be removed.
- `scripts` - Contains the documentjs configuration code, including custom css, js, templates and specifies the scripts that comprise CanJS.

## Deploy

Update all submodules and submodule references first and push them to GitHub, then commit and push this
repository back to `gh-pages`.

## Notes

- Always keep submodule references up to date by running the `update` command above.
- When pulling from `gh-pages` (or any other branch off of it), remember to `npm install` in case new packages were added.
- Only push to gh-pages for a new release, it will update the homepage right away
- *Do not modify any HTML and CSS files directly. They are generated when running the Grunt tasks.*
