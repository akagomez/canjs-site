For the past couple months, we've been holding weekly CanJS community meetings every Friday at 3PM CST. Anyone is welcome to join.

## How to Sign Up

To sign up to watch, visit the [CanJS Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/108820831381167297339/posts), where we'll post an event every Monday. After the event is posted (we'll post Monday morning), click Yes where it asks if you'll be attending. You should then receive a notification when the meeting is starting.

Its a great time to:

 * ask specific questions about your app or a certain bug you've stuggled with
 * learn about a feature of CanJS from a core team member
 * listen to discussion around some aspect of architecture or JS
 * stay up to date on roadmap progress

The format we're using is:

 * One team member does a "beginner demo" lasting 15 minutes
 * A panel with core members and a non-core member discuss some topic of interest
 * Q&A from anyone watching

## Previous Hangouts

For example, last week:

 * Brian gave a 15 minute demo about can.route.map and using it to tie your app's state to your URL routes
 * Brad gave a 10 minute talk on his experiences using CanJS over the past couple years
 * David gave a 10 minute talk on the difference between pattern-based routing and state-based routing, and why CanJS favors state-based routing for better architectures

Here's last week's meeting:

You can see all the previous hangouts on the [Google+ Video page](https://plus.google.com/108820831381167297339/videos).

We'll be writing up short postmortems of what we covered each week here on the blog.

See you next Friday!
